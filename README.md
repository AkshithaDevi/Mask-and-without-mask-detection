# Mask-and-without-mask-detection
Build a Neural Network, to classify “mask” and “without_mask” images
initially i have created an account in kaggle to upload the dataset file of people face with mask and without mask 
download the json file from kaggle and upload in google colab by creating a new file
if needed i have provided the kaggle.json file in the repository
after import the required packages and follow the steps that are present in untitiled0.ipynb file and check out the results..>>
for this face detected model i have using **convolutional neural networks(cnn)**
